# Commands

To execute a command, press space and type the command. There is fuzzy match support, so it is enough to type parts of the command name and it will display options that matches.

It is also possible to create a command file, extension `.sucl`, and run that. Running a command file can be done from within Surfer using the menu option in the File menu, through the toolbar button, or by typing the command ``run_command_file``. It can also be done using the ``--command-file`` argument when starting Surfer.

Not all commands are available unless a file is loaded. Also, some commands are not available in the WASM-build (browser/VS Code extension).

## Waveform/transaction loading and reloading

* ``load_file <FILE_NAME>``

    Load a file. Note that it works to load a waveform file from a command file.

    <div class="warning">In WASM-builds (web browser/VS Code plugin) it is not possible to open a file due to file access restrictions. Use <tt>load_url</tt>.</div>


* ``switch_file <FILE_NAME>``

    Load file, but keep waveform view.

* ``load_url <URL>``

    Load a URL.

* ``reload``

    Reload the current file. Does not work in a web browser.

* ``remove_unavailable``

    Remove variables that are not longer present in the reloaded/switched file.

## Add variable/transaction items

* ``scope_add <SCOPE_NAME>``, ``stream_add``, ``module_add``

    Add all variables in the specified scope to the waveform display. ``module_add`` is an alias for ``scope_add``.

* ``scope_add_recursive <SCOPE_NAME>``

    Add all variables in the specified scope and from all sub-scopes to the waveform display.

    <div class="warning">Adding large hierarchies with a large number of variables can freeze surfer for a significant amount of time.</div>

* ``scope_add_as_group <SCOPE_NAME>``

    Add all variables in the specified scope to the waveform display in a newly created group of the same name.

* ``scope_add_as_group_recursive <SCOPE_NAME>``

    Add all variables in the specified scope and all sub-scopes to the waveform display in a newly created groups nested.

    <div class="warning">Adding large hierarchies with a large number of variables can freeze surfer for a significant amount of time.</div>

* ``variable_add <FULL_VARIABLE_NAME>``, ``generator_add  <FULL_GENERATOR_NAME>``

    Add a variable/generator using the full path, including scopes/streams.

* ``scope_select <SCOPE_NAME>``, ``stream_select <STREAM_NAME>``

    Select a scope/stream to be active (shown in the side panel).

* ``scope_select_root``, ``stream_select_root``

    Deselect the active scope/stream (resets to the root).

* ``variable_add_from_scope <VARIABLE_NAME>``, ``generator_add_from_stream <GENERATOR_NAME>``

    Add variable/generator from currently selected scope/stream.

## Add other items

* ``divider_add [NAME]``

  Add a divider with the optional given name.

* ``timeline_add``

  Add a timeline row.

## Created and edited signals

Signals can be created and drawn by hand next to the signals loaded from a waveform file.
They appear in a top-level scope named ``user`` and are kept in memory only.

Bit-vector signals loaded from the file can be edited the same way in edit mode, writing 0
and 1 values. The file itself is not changed: edits are kept in memory, marked with a pencil
next to the signal's name, and can be undone or reverted. Editing a signal also edits every
other name for the same stored signal (for example ``tb.clk`` and ``tb.dut.clk``). Edits are
dropped when the file is reloaded, and the FST export still writes the file's values.

* ``signal_create <NAME> <WIDTH>``

  Create a signal ``NAME`` that is ``WIDTH`` bits wide, initially 0, and add it to the view.

* ``signal_set <NAME> <START> <END> <VALUE>``

  Set created signal ``NAME`` to ``VALUE`` from time ``START`` up to (not including) ``END``.
  Use ``-`` as ``END`` to set the value until the end of the waveform. ``VALUE`` is decimal,
  or hexadecimal, binary or octal with a ``0x``, ``0b`` or ``0o`` prefix.

* ``edit_mode_toggle``

  Toggle edit mode, for drawing on created signals with the mouse. Edits snap to cells, see
  ``edit_snap_to``, and a preview of the edit is shown under the pointer.

  One-bit signals are painted: the height of the pointer in the row picks the level (top half
  high, bottom half low). Clicking paints the cell under the pointer, and dragging paints every
  cell the pointer passes, following its height. A whole stroke is undone at once.

  For multi-bit signals, dragging selects a range of cells and clicking selects the clicked
  segment. The value is then typed into a box in the row, in the signal's display format
  (hexadecimal, binary, octal or decimal) unless prefixed with ``0x``, ``0b``, ``0o`` or ``0d``.
  Enter sets the value, Escape cancels.

* ``signal_revert <VARIABLE>``

  Remove the edits of a signal loaded from the waveform file, restoring the file's values.
  Edits of a file signal apply to every name (alias) of the same stored signal, so they are
  reverted together.

* ``signal_revert_all``

  Remove the edits of all signals loaded from the waveform file.

* ``edit_snap_to <ticks | VARIABLE>``

  Choose what edits snap to: the cells between the timeline's tick marks (the default), or
  the cells between the transitions of ``VARIABLE``, for example a clock. While in edit mode,
  a signal's context menu also has "Snap edits to this signal".

## Groups

* ``group_marked [NAME]``

    Group the currently selected items into a new group with the optional given name.

* ``group_dissolve``

  Remove the focused group, moving its contents to the parent level.

* ``group_fold_recursive``

  Collapse the focused group and all nested groups.

* ``group_unfold_recursive``

  Expand the focused group and all nested groups.

* ``group_fold_all``

## Frame buffer

* ``frame_buffer_set_array <SCOPE_NAME>`` / ``frame_buffer_set_variable <VARIABLE_NAME>``

  Set the data source for the frame buffer. Use ``frame_buffer_set_array`` to source pixel data
  from a memory array (a scope), or ``frame_buffer_set_variable`` to source it from a single
  variable.

* ``frame_buffer_set_mode <grayscale | rgb | ycbcr> <BITS> [BITS2 BITS3]``

  * ``grayscale <BITS>`` — each pixel is a single grey value of `BITS` bits (1–8).
  * ``rgb <R_BITS> <G_BITS> <B_BITS>`` — each pixel is packed as red/green/blue with the given bit widths (each 0–8).
  * ``ycbcr <Y_BITS> <CB_BITS> <CR_BITS>`` — each pixel is packed as Y/Cb/Cr (BT.601) with the given bit widths (each 0–8).

  Examples:

  ```
  frame_buffer_set_mode grayscale 8
  frame_buffer_set_mode rgb 5 6 5
  frame_buffer_set_mode ycbcr 8 8 8
  ```

* ``frame_buffer_set_width <WIDTH>``

  Set the number of pixels per row in the frame buffer display.

* ``frame_buffer_set_range <FIRST> <LAST> [FIRST2 LAST2 ...]``

  Set the displayed index range for each array level. Pairs of integers are matched to levels
  in order; extra pairs beyond the number of levels are ignored. Each value is clamped to the
  valid range of its level, and if `FIRST` > `LAST` the values are swapped automatically.

  Example — set level 0 to rows 0–479 and level 1 to columns 0–639:

  ```
  frame_buffer_set_range 0 479 0 639
  ```
